# Bitlocker Revamped
## Yes, I'm staying with the name Bitlocker until Tinyflaccid sues me.
---
I'm going to be rewriting Bitlocker, this time using tools like Tokio and Crossterm to build my CLI.

This reimplementation will act more like a CLI, and less like a choose your own adventure game build by an 8-year-old.

I'll also include builds for more CPU architectures, using Github Actions + Docker.

This new version of Bitlocker will be released under the GPL v2 license, so my works will always be open-source.
